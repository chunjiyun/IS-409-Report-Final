        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          This project introduces a sustainable vacuum bagging system that replaces traditional single-use materials
          with a reusable silicone sheet. Leveraging silicone's high thermal resistance and elongation properties, the
          system addresses key challenges in in-house composite manufacturing, including cost, waste, time, and skill
          dependency. Experiments characterized silicone behavior under vacuum, evaluated mold compatibility and edge
          conformity, and examined the relationship between mold height and curvature. The design was validated through
          the fabrication of composite heel rest and brake heel rest components for a NUS FSAE race car, demonstrating
          reduced weight and enhanced performance compared to the conventional 3D printing method they use.

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Composite material is made from combining two or more different materials with distinct physical or chemical
          properties to create unique properties such as enhanced strength and reduced weight compared to the original
          material alone. Composite materials are the product of fiber material, such as carbon, and matrix material,
          like epoxy resin. Fiber is the key to strength and stiffness, and matrix material acts as a bonding agent,
          holding the fiber together. (McClements & Lichtig, 2023) One of the commonly used composite materials is
          carbon fiber.

        <h3>1.1. Growing Global Demand For Composite Materials</h3>
        <p>
          Recent statistics, shown in Figure 2, show that the market value of composite materials worldwide is projected
          to increase to 67 billion U.S. dollars in 2031 from 49.3 billion U.S. dollars in 2024. (Lucintel, 2025) Due to
          the superior strength-to-weight ratio, durability, and design flexibility of composite materials, they are
          commonly used in transportation (e.g. race cars, aircraft), electronics, and construction market as shown in
          Figure 3. (AVK, 2025) For example, the main body and the wings of an aircraft can be manufactured using
          composite material illustrated in Figure 4.

          1.2. Composite Manufacturing In Industry vs. In-House
        </h3>
        <p>
          In large-scale industries such as Boeing, they often manufacture large volumes and large-scale composite
          parts. Therefore, such large industries use highly advanced and established technologies like automated fiber
          placement to fabricate their air vehicle structures (Brasington et al., 2021), which is shown in Figure 5
          below. Automated fiber placement uses a robotic system to lay down strips of fiber material onto the mold of
          the part that is desired to be manufactured. (Brasington et al., 2021)
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/turbine.png"
          subtitle="Figure 5: Automated Fiber Placement Machine in Industrial Use (George Marsh, 2011)"></image-component>
        <p>
          However, as global market value and demand for composite materials increase, composite manufacturing is no
          longer confined to large-scale industries. Instead, composites are fabricated on a smaller scale and in lower
          volumes. This is called <i>in-house composite manufacturing</i>. This method typically employs a hand lay-up
          process,
          where the technician manually lays composite materials onto a mold, rather than relying on advanced robotic
          systems. In-house composite manufacturing is favored by markets producing diverse part sizes, lower production
          volumes, and customized products to meet specific consumer needs. For example, the National University of
          Singapore Formula SAE team uses composite materials to produce various parts in their race car, as carbon
          fiber exhibits a high strength-to-weight ratio making it suitable for high-performance race cars. This
          includes
          larger structures like the front wing, which is 1.3m x 0.5m x 0.06m (Figure 6), as well as an electronics box
          which can be as small as 15cm x 15cm x 15cm.

          1.3. Three In-House Composite Manufacturing Processes
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are three major carbon fiber lay-up processes for in-house manufacturing: Wet lay-up, resin transfer
          molding and prepreg lay-up.<br /><br />Wet lay-up is done by manually applying resin to the layers of dry
          fiber reinforcement. This requires handling wet resin and ensuring that the resin is evenly distributed with
          the right amount. (Campbell, 2004)
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/wet-lay-up.png" subtitle="Figure 7: Wet lay-up"></image-component>
        <p>
          Resin transfer molding uses a resin injection system to inject the resin into a closed mold containing dry
          carbon fibers. (Jamir et al., 2018)
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/resin-transfer.png"
          subtitle="Figure 8: Resin Transfer Molding"></image-component>
        <p>
          Lastly, prepreg lay-up is carbon fiber that has already been coated with a partially hardened resin. Instead
          of pouring liquid resin onto the carbon fiber by hand, each sheet already has the right amount of resin evenly
          spread through it. These sheets are carefully placed on top of each other on the mold of the part that you
          want to produce. Then, once the stack of layers is complete, they’re placed under vacuum and heated (often in
          an oven) to complete the curing process and is demolded. (Campbell, 2004)
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/blue-car.png" subtitle="Figure 9: Prepreg"></image-component>
        <p>
          Out of the three carbon fiber layup processes, this project will use prepreg in the subsequent sections of the
          report. Prepregs offer consistent quality of composite parts as there is a uniform fiber-to-resin ratio and
          consistent thickness per ply. They are also the easiest ones to handle as it doesn’t use liquid resins and
          this effectively reduces the curing time since the resin system is already partially cured.

          Manufacturing a functional composite part using prepreg involves a series of steps and several auxiliary
          materials. Table 1 provides a detailed breakdown of the key steps involved in this process.

          1.5. Challenges In Vacuum Bagging Process
        </h3>
        <p>
          Although the vacuum bagging process is a crucial step in any in-house composite manufacturing process, it
          poses four major challenges:
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
          <li>Skill dependency</li>
          <li>Time intensive</li>
          <li>High cost</li>
          <li>Environmental impact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The first challenge is that vacuum bagging is a highly skill-dependent process. As the vacuum pump sucks out
          the air inside, the vacuum bag easily forms folds on the lay-up, especially for deep corners and complex
          shapes. These folds are very critical as they can lead to inconsistent vacuum pressure, resulting in bridging,
          voids, or pinholes that can compromise the strength and quality of the final composite part. Therefore, a
          proper pleating process is required by the technician when vacuuming the bag to ensure that it’s fully
          conformed to the mold, including deep corners. This increases the complexity of the process and increases the
          demand for skilled labor, making it a challenging method for less experienced technicians to perform.
          <br /><br />
          The second challenge is the time intensity of the process. Because there are several steps involved in the
          vacuum bagging process such as bagging, sealing and monitoring the conformity of the vacuum bag, this
          increases the overall production time. This reduces the productivity and efficiency of producing composite
          parts.
          <br /><br />
          The third challenge is the high cost of vacuum bagging materials. For instance, NUS purchases a roll of vacuum
          bagging film every year which costs $1562 SGD while the sealant tape costs $5.47 SGD per roll. Table 2 shows
          the specifications of the materials purchased at NUS. Such expenses can add up quickly when the project scale
          or volume increases.
        </p>
        <table-component subtitle="Table 2: Specifications of Vacuum Bagging Film and Sealant Tape Purchased by NUS">
          <div id="table-2"></div>
          </p>
        </table-component>
        <p>
          The last challenge is the significant waste produced in the process. The vacuum bagging film, sealant tape,
          release film, and breather fabric are all disposable materials, leading to substantial waste. Vacuum bagging
          film typically produces the greatest amount of waste, as it is often cut significantly larger than the mold
          dimensions to accommodate the required pleating during vacuum application. The film undergoes high plastic
          deformation when it’s vacuumed, hence it cannot be reused but will be disposed of after a single use. Finding
          sustainable alternatives or reusable options for these materials would reduce waste and lessen the
          environmental footprint of composite manufacturing.
          <br /><br />
          There is a need for an innovative solution to make vacuum bagging less skill-dependent, more time and
          cost-efficient, and more environmentally friendly, which would contribute to a more sustainable and seamless
          approach to the overall composite manufacturing.

          Designing a vacuum bagging system that reduces cost and environmental impact using a reusable vacuum bag

        <h3>4.1. Design Specifications For Reusable Vacuum Bagging Material</h3>
        <p>
          To establish the design specifications for a reusable vacuum bagging material, the traditional vacuum bagging
          film SL850’s material property (temperature, elongation, reusability) is used as the benchmark. This is shown
          in Table 3.
        </p>
        <table-component subtitle="Comparative Material Properties of SL850, Rubber, Silicone, and Polyurethane">
          <div id="table-3"></div>
        </table-component>
        <p>Hence, the reusable vacuum bagging material should have the following design specifications:</p>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
          <li><strong>Temperature</strong>: Withstand 180°C, as that is the maximum curing temperature in the
            oven/autoclave</li>
          <li><strong>Elongation</strong>: Have at least 450% elongation rate at break to achieve high conformity around
            the lay-up</li>
          <li><strong>Reusability</strong>: The material can be reused with minimal plastic deformation after being
            used. Also, it
            doesn’t get contaminated by resin</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Easy to source in Singapore and inexpensive</li>
          <li><strong>Customizable Size</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Ideally Translucent</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Rubber, silicone, and polyurethane were selected for comparison because they are common, readily available
          elastomers. Table 3 presents a comparative analysis of the material properties of the benchmark material
          (SL850) alongside these elastomers.
          <br /><br />
          Rubber and polyurethane have maximum temperature tolerances of only 82°C and 93°C, respectively. Those
          temperatures are below the typical curing conditions, which would lead to their melting during the curing
          process. Moreover, both materials exhibit plastic deformation when stretched, making them unsuitable for
          reusable vacuum bagging applications
          <br /><br />
          In contrast, silicone can endure temperatures up to 315°C and, depending on its thickness, can achieve
          elongation of up to 1490%. Consequently, <strong>silicone</strong> was selected as the most reusable vacuum
          bagging material.

          4.2. Sourcing And Purchasing Of Silicone Sheet
        </h3>
        <p>
          The reusable vacuum bagging material should be readily accessible within Singapore to avoid dependency on
          limited suppliers, thereby minimizing potential delays in the composite manufacturing process.
          <br /><br />
          In Singapore, two prominent global distributors, RS Components and Misumi, provide industrial and electronic
          products. Figure 12 illustrates three types of silicone sheets offered by RS Components, starting at S$110.06,
          with prices increasing for thicker options. This pricing fails to meet the design specification, as it is
          expensive and would counteract the cost-saving objective of the project.

          subtitle="Figure 12: Silicones in RS Components"></image-component>
        <p>
          More affordable silicone sheet options are available through online platforms such as Aliexpress, presenting
          an opportunity to substantially reduce composite manufacturing costs. There are numerous suppliers on
          Aliexpress that offer silicone sheets in various thicknesses.
          <br /><br />
          Using the SL850 vacuum bagging film, which has a thickness of 0.05 mm, as a benchmark, silicone sheets with
          thicknesses of 0.2 mm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm were purchased from Aliexpress. This diverse range of
          thicknesses will facilitate data-driven decision-making by allowing elongation measurements to determine the
          most suitable silicone for vacuum bagging applications. Figure 13 illustrates the silicone sheets purchased
          from Aliexpress, including their respective prices.

          5. ASTM D412 Experiment With Silicone
        </h2>
        <p>
          A limitation when purchasing silicone sheets from Aliexpress is the potential unreliability of their stated
          elongation specifications, as these values are typically not verified by established sources.
          <br /><br />
          Therefore, it is necessary to measure their elongation rate and analyze their mechanical behavior to assess
          their suitability for vacuum bagging applications. ASTM D412 was used as a guideline to conduct this
          assessment.
          <br /><br />
          ASTM D412 is a standard test method established by ASTM International for determining the tensile properties
          of rubber and elastomers, which can be used for measuring key mechanical properties such as tensile strength,
          elongation at break, and stress-strain behavior under uniaxial tensile loading. (Standard Test Methods for
          Vulcanized Rubber and Thermoplastic Elastomers—Tension, 2021) It uses dogbone-shaped specimens in the test.

        <p>
          <i>The silicone’s elongation will meet the design specifications for reusable vacuum bagging material, while
            thinner specimens will elongate more than thicker specimens with less force required.</i>
          <br /><br />
          This hypothesis was established based on the known mechanical properties of silicone elastomers, which are
          characterized by high elasticity and the ability to undergo significant elongation without permanent
          deformation.
          <br /><br />
          Furthermore, principles of material mechanics suggest that thinner specimens generally require less force to
          achieve the same level of elongation compared to thicker ones due to their reduced cross-sectional area and
          lower resistance to tensile forces.

          5.4. Experiment Procedure
        </h3>
        <p>
          An Instron 34TM-5 universal testing machine was used to conduct the tensile tests on the silicone specimens.
          The machine was configured with a grip-to-grip separation of 33 mm and a gauge length of 25 mm to accommodate
          the standardized specimen dimensions. Grip pressure was maintained at 100 psi (689 kPa) to ensure secure
          holding of the specimens without causing premature failure or slippage during testing. The tests were
          performed at a speed of 500 ± 50 mm/min, adhering to the guidelines specified in ASTM D412.
          <br /><br />
          Each silicone specimen was elongated until it broke to determine the material's ultimate elongation and
          tensile strength. See Figure 17 for a video footage of the testing for one of the specimens.

          5.5. Experiment Results And Analysis
        </h3>
        <p>
          During the experiment, the machine collected multiple displacement readings for the same force value,
          resulting in a one-to-many relationship between force and displacement data points. Therefore, data cleaning
          was performed to establish a one-to-one mapping between force and displacement. See Appendix A for the data
          cleaning method.
          <br /><br />
          Figure 18 shows the compiled scatter plot of all 13 specimens. Three 0.2mm specimens slipped off from the
          machine grip, hence they are not included in the graph. The plot shows that 0.5mm thickness elongates the most
          with the least force required to stretch to that point. This can be seen by the orange line that stretches the
          furthest. 2mm (purple) and 1.5mm both broke at similar elongation. However, 2mm (green) requires greater force
          to elongate. There is a clear trend where thicker specimens require more force to reach similar displacement
          values. The 2.0 mm specimen, represented in purple, shows the highest force values for a given displacement,
          followed by the 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.2 mm specimens. Thinner specimens (0.2 mm) reach higher displacements at
          much lower forces, indicating greater flexibility but lower strength compared to thicker specimens.

        <p>
          See Appendix B for the individual scatter plot per thickness.
          <br /><br />
          Table 4 summarizes the experiment results. 0.5 mm specimen has the highest elongation at break (301 mm) and
          percentage elongation (1200%), indicating it can stretch the most before breaking. This suggests an optimal
          balance of flexibility and strength for this thickness. The 0.2 mm specimen shows significant elongation (167
          mm, 668%), but due to its low force threshold (0.0066 kN), it is less resistant to higher forces, making it
          weaker than the thicker specimens. The 1.0 mm and 2.0 mm specimens exhibit reduced elongation percentages
          (760% and 716%, respectively) but can withstand higher forces (0.0324 kN and 0.06055 kN, respectively),
          indicating greater strength than 0.2mm.

          6.1. Concept Design Generation
        </h3>
        <p>
          The initial stage of this concept design centers on substituting the traditional vacuum bagging film with a
          reusable silicone sheet.
          <br /><br />
          Based on the results of previous elongation experiments, the reusable vacuum bagging system will utilize
          silicone sheets with thicknesses of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, as these options exhibited the highest elongation
          values.
          <br /><br />
          Table 5 shows the traditional vacuum bagging layout and the proposed layout. The traditional layout relies on
          sealant tape and vacuum bagging film to create an enclosed environment over the prepreg layup on an aluminum
          plate. The vacuum port is connected to the top of the vacuum bag. By contrast, the proposed layout replaces
          both the sealant tape and disposable vacuum film with a silicone sheet. This change directly addresses the
          goal of reducing material waste by eliminating two major disposable items in the traditional vacuum bagging
          process.

          vs. Silicone Vacuum Bagging System</p>
        <p>
          However, this change in the vacuum bagging layout introduces two major design challenges that must be
          addressed.
          <br /><br />
          <ins>Challenge 1: Sealing The Prepreg Layup Without Sealant Tape</ins>
          <br />
          In the traditional approach, sealant tape holds the vacuum bagging film securely against the aluminum plate,
          ensuring no air can leak into the vacuum space. Eliminating the sealant tape in the proposed silicone vacuum
          bagging layout means the silicone sheet must still form a tight seal against the plate, but without relying on
          a single-use adhesive. This requirement precludes any sealing method that involves bolting or perforating the
          silicone, as creating holes in the sheet would lead to tearing under tension.
          <br /><br />
          <ins>Challenge 2: Vacuum Port Placement</ins>
          <br />
          In traditional vacuum bagging, the vacuum hose is connected through the bagging film using a small fitting
          from the top of the bag, shown in Figure 19. This is done by cutting or punching a hole in the plastic film so
          air can be sucked out. However, in the new layout that uses a silicone sheet, creating a hole in the silicone
          sheet would cause the whole silicone sheet to tear under vacuum pressure. This compromises the reusability. As
          a result, the vacuum port must be relocated to preserve the silicone sheet’s integrity.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/vacuum-hose.png"
          subtitle="Figure 19: Vacuum Hose Location in Traditional Layout (Laminating with Pre-Pregs, 2020)"></image-component>
        <p>
          Therefore, the complete vacuum bagging system should address these challenges while accommodating the silicone
          sheet.
          <br /><br />
          The concept design for the reusable vacuum bagging system was inspired by the principles of vacuum forming
          machines. In vacuum forming, a heated plastic sheet is drawn over a mold by applying vacuum pressure, causing
          the sheet to conform to the mold’s contours, as illustrated in Figure 20. The machine consists of a top frame
          and a bottom frame, which are clamped together with the mold positioned in between. As air is evacuated from
          the bottom of the frame, the heated plastic is pressed firmly against the mold, resulting in precise
          conformation to its shape.

        <p>
          The final concept design for the silicone vacuum bagging system is illustrated in Figure 21. This
          system features two identical square frames connected by hinges, allowing them to open and close. The prepreg
          layup is placed on an aluminum plate, which is bolted to the bottom frame to enhance the overall integrity of
          the system. Once the layup is positioned, the frames are clamped shut, enabling the silicone sheet to cover
          and conform to the prepreg layup as air is evacuated, thus consolidating the composite structure. The four
          legs elevate the frame assembly to allow the vacuum port to be located below the aluminium profile.

          All the frames and legs are built using aluminum T-slot profiles due to their versatility, good resistance to
          high curing temperature, and its ease of sourcing. Specifically, this project uses Prestech’s 30 series
          aluminium profiles to ensure the stability of the system.

        <h2>7. Cost Benefit Analysis of the Purchased Silicone</h2>
        <p>
          This section of the report presents a series of vacuuming tests conducted using the frame system and silicone
          sheet, which examines mold compatibility and how the silicone behaves for extreme edges and angles.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-7-header-1">
        <h3>7.1. Test 1: Mold Compatibility for Silicone Vacuum Bagging</h3>
        <p>
          In the traditional vacuum bagging process, either male or female mold can be used to lay-up composites.
          However, in the silicone vacuum bagging system, only male molds are feasible because the silicone cannot
          conform to the interior surfaces of a female mold. To illustrate, a roll of tape, representing a female mold
          due to its hollow interior, was vacuumed in this frame assembly. See Figure 25. When the vacuum is applied,
          the silicone fails to conform to the inner surface and instead stops near the top of the tape. It also
          compromised the silicone sheet, showing plastic deformation. This observation indicates that the silicone
          vacuum bagging system is limited to male molds, where the silicone can properly conform to the mold’s
          exterior surface.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2. Test 2: Examining How Sharp Edges (Non-Concave) Behave Under Vacuum</h3>
        <p>
          This test examines how the silicone sheet conforms to the mold with 90-degree edges under vacuum conditions.
          <br /><br />
          For this test, a rectangular block sample (13cm x 6cm x 3cm) was vacuumed. See Figure 26. From simple
          observation, the silicone sheet conformed to the mold very well in general. The silicone creates a radius
          along the aluminium sheet, which is circled in yellow. This behavior is inevitable because the system is not
          designed for pleating, but to naturally conform to the mold under vacuum conditions. In the current block
          sample, the curvature does not compromise the overall quality of the vacuum bag, as the silicone sheet
          maintains contact with all surfaces exposed to the vacuum. However, along the lower edges where the block
          contacts the aluminum plate, there is a small area where the silicone may not fully engage with the block,
          which prompted the development of Test 3.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-7-header-3">
        <h3>7.3. Test 3: Evaluating Mold Height And Radius Formation Across Different Sample Dimensions</h3>
        <p>
          There is an inherent limitation in the dimensions that the frame system can accommodate, as the frames must be
          able to clamp together effectively. In the previous test, the rectangular block conformed well under vacuum
          conditions, although a small radius was observed at the bottom edges. This observation suggests that as the
          height of the vacuumed part increases, the frames may not be able to fully close, and a correlation might
          exist between the part's height and the curvature (radius) produced under vacuum. Therefore, this test
          examines the maximum allowable mold height that the system can accommodate and investigates the relationship
          between the part's height and the resulting radius under vacuum conditions.
          <br /><br />
          For this test, four different-sized cubes were used:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>15cmx15cmx15cm</li>
          <li>10cmx10cmx10cm</li>
          <li>8.5cmx8.5cmx8.5cm</li>
          <li>5cmx5cmx5cm</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The largest cube sample, measuring 15 cm, prevented the frames from fully closing when positioned between
          them. This is shown in Figure 27. This indicates that the frame system is limited to accommodating composite
          layouts with a height below 15 cm. This result establishes the system’s upper-dimensional limit on the mold
          height.

          subtitle="Figure 27: 15cm Cube Unable To Close Frames"></image-component>
        <p>
          A 10cm cube was successfully clamped. However, vacuum application resulted in a notably large radius at the
          bottom edge. See Figure 28. Furthermore, variations in the curvature were observed along different edges, with
          the edge near the vacuum port exhibiting a larger radius than the edge further away. Similar vacuum tests were
          performed on 8.5 cm and 5 cm cubes. Find Appendix D for the video footage of 10cm cube under vacuumm.

        <p>
          To establish the relationship between the cube's height and the induced curvature, the distance from the top
          of the cube to the point at which the curvature begins was measured using a vernier caliper. Figure 31
          illustrates the specific measurements that were recorded. The data is recorded in Table 8 and plotted in
          Figure 32.

        <p>
          According to Figure 32, the experimental data indicate a positive correlation between the height of the cube
          and the magnitude of the curvature created during vacuum bagging. In other words, as the height of the cube
          increases, the measured radius of the concave formed by the silicone also increases. This result implies that
          the silicone may have limitations in achieving a tight seal on taller geometries.

        <h2>8. Fabricating A Composite Prototype Using Silicone Vacuum Bagging</h2>
        <p>
          A fully functional composite prototype was fabricated to validate the silicone vacuum bagging system. In this
          project, heel rest and brake heel rest components were selected for lay-up. Heel rests, which secure the
          driver's side-to-side movement during races, are essential components in a race car, also utilized by the NUS
          FSAE team. The NUS FSAE team traditionally employs 3D printing with ABS material to make them, shown in
          Figures 33 and 34 below. However, by using carbon fiber, which has a high strength-to-weight ratio, the
          overall weight of the vehicle can be reduced while simultaneously enhancing its performance.

        <h3>8.1. Mold Preparation</h3>
        <p>
          As shown in Test 1 of Section 7.1, the silicone sheet is unable to conform to interior surfaces. Hence, the
          original design is unsuitable as a lay-up mold for components where the inner surface geometry is critical.
          Consequently, both designs were revised to incorporate male molds, as shown in Figures 35 and 36 below. These
          molds were 3D printed using ABS material, which was selected for its capacity to withstand the required curing
          temperatures.

        <p>
          Due to the curvature created by the silicone sheet against the aluminum plate under vacuum (as detailed in
          Sections 7.2 and 7.3), additional allowances were incorporated into the mold design. The prepreg lay-up is
          applied over these allowances so that, upon curing, the excess material in these areas can be trimmed away,
          ensuring that only the required portion of the part is retained. This process is illustrated in Figure 37.

          Five plies of prepreg were applied to each mold. A release film was then placed above the prepreg to
          facilitate demolding, and a breather fabric was applied to ensure uniform vacuum airflow. The complete lay-up
          was subsequently transferred to an autoclave and cured at 85°C for six hours. Figure 39 illustrates the
          pre-cure lay-up.

        <h3>8.3. Edge Radius Evaluation And Conformity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          If the silicone sheet conforms to the lay-up successfully, the radius of the bottom edges of the final part
          should be at least the same or even smaller than the pre-cure radius of the prepreg lay-up. Therefore, their
          radius was measured using the same testing method as in Figure 31.

          subtitle="Table 9: The Measured Green Lengths And Pink Lengths From Figure 41"></image-component>
        <p>
          According to Table 9, the pink length—which represents the radius of the pre-cure part—is smaller than the
          green length, which corresponds to the radius of the final composite part. This finding indicates that the
          silicone sheet conformed tightly to the lay-up, thereby minimizing bridging and void formation in the
          manufactured composite part.
          <br /><br />
          The successful fabrication of the heel rest and brake heel rest components validates that the integrated
          silicone vacuum bagging system is effective for manufacturing these critical composite parts. This validation
          not only highlights the system's capability to produce high-performance, lightweight components for
          applications such as the NUS FSAE race car but also underscores its potential to streamline the manufacturing
          process by reducing reliance on single-use materials, thereby offering both economic and environmental
          benefits. Table 10 shows the reduction of the mass (g) when it is manufactured using prepreg.

      <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates the feasibility of a novel, sustainable vacuum bagging system that employs a reusable
        silicone sheet as an alternative to the traditional single-use vacuum bagging films and sealant tapes. By
        leveraging silicone’s superior thermal stability and high elongation properties, the developed vacuum bagging
        system not only reduces material waste and production costs but also minimizes the skill dependency typically
        associated with manual vacuum bagging processes.
        <br /><br />
        Experimental testing with the system, including assessments of mold compatibility, edge conformity, and the
        relationship between mold height and curvature under vacuum conditions, gives meaningful insights into the high
        conformity of silicone under vacuum as well as the limitations of the system.
        <br /><br />
        The fabrication of composite prototypes, specifically the heel rest and brake heel rest components for the NUS
        FSAE race car, validates the system's capability to produce high-quality, lightweight composite parts. These
        results underscore the potential of the silicone vacuum bagging system to streamline in-house composite
        manufacturing while enhancing overall performance and sustainability.

      <h2>10. Future Work</h2>
      <p>
        Future work should aim at assessing the long-term reusability of the silicone vacuum bagging material.
        Specifically, it is critical to determine whether the radius of the silicone, which plays a key role in ensuring
        proper conformity and vacuum integrity, changes over repeated use. Such variations could arise from gradual
        material fatigue, plastic deformation, or slight changes in the silicone's elastic properties over multiple
        curing cycles.
        <br /><br />
        In addition, the effect of part orientation on the formation of the concave during vacuum bagging should be
        investigated to further refine the system's design for various composite geometries. Since the orientation may
        impact how the silicone conforms to the mold, potentially leading to variations in curvature and void formation.
        The insights gained from these studies will be instrumental in refining the system's design, ensuring consistent
        performance and quality across a range of composite manufacturing applications.

        <h3>Appendix A: Data Cleaning Procedure</h3>
        <p>
          During the experiment, the testing machine collected
          multiple displacement readings for the same force value,
          resulting in a one-to-many relationship between force
          and displacement data points. For example, at a force of
          0.001 kN, several displacement measurements were
          recorded. When plotted, this data produced a graph (see
          Appendix Figure 1) that made it difficult to determine the
          elongation at specific force levels.
        </p>

          subtitle="Appendix Figure 1: Scatter plot for 0.2mm before data cleaning"></image-component>
        <p>
          To resolve this issue, data cleaning was performed to
          establish a one-to-one mapping between force and
          displacement. The following steps were taken:
          <br />
          <br />
          1. <ins>Identify the Failure Point</ins>: The point at
          which each specimen failed was identified in the
          dataset.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. <ins>Sort Force Data</ins>: Force values were sorted
          in ascending order from 0 N up to the failure point for
          each specimen.
          <br />
          <br />
          3. <ins>Generate New Force Dataset</ins>: A new set of
          force values was created, starting from 0 N with
          increments of 0.0001 kN.
          <br />
          <br />
          4. <ins>Average Displacement Values</ins>: For each
          force value in the new dataset, the average displacement
          was calculated from the multiple displacement readings
          corresponding to that force. This ensured a one-to-one
          correspondence between force and displacement.
          <br />
          <br />
          5. <ins>Use Raw Data Beyond Failure Point</ins>: From
          the failure point onwards, the raw force and
          displacement data were retained without modification.
          <br />
          <br />
          6. <ins>Create Scatter Plot</ins>: A scatter plot was
          generated using the cleaned force and displacement data,
          resulting in a clearer representation of the material's
          behavior.
          <br />
          <br />
          This data cleaning process was repeated for specimens
          with thicknesses of 0.2 mm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm to
          ensure consistency and accuracy across all tests.

        Appendix C: Cost-Benefit Analysis Of The Purchased Silicone
      </h3>
      <p>
        The cost-benefit analysis quantifies the potential savings achievable by employing silicone for vacuum
        bagging.
        <br /><br />
        A single roll of SL850 vacuum bagging film measures 304 m in length, 1.22 m in width, and 0.0508 mm in
        thickness, and is priced at S$1562. Given that a 1 m × 1 m film is required for each composite layup, one roll
        can facilitate approximately 304 vacuum bagging operations, resulting in a cost of S$5.14 per operation
        (1562/304 = S$5.14).
        <br /><br />
        In comparison, a 0.2 mm silicone sheet, with dimensions of 1 m in length and 0.5 m in width, costs S$11.31.
        Dividing the silicone cost by the SL850 cost yields a factor of 2.20 (11.31/5.14 = 2.20), indicating that if
        the silicone sheet can be reused at least three times, its cost would be offset relative to the cost of
        single-use SL850 vacuum bags.
        <br /><br />
        Future work will include testing with an actual composite mold to verify the reusability and
        cost-effectiveness of the silicone sheet.
